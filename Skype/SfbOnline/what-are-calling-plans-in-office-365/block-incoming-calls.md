 # Block Inbound Calls

Skype for Business Online Calling Plans now supports blocking of inbound calls from the public switched telephone network (PSTN). This feature allows a tenant global list of number patterns to be defined so that the caller ID of every incoming PSTN call to the tenant can be checked against the list for a match. If a match is made, an incoming call is rejected. 

This inbound call blocking feature only works on inbound calls originating from the PSTN and only works on a tenant global basis and is not available on a per user basis.

This feature is not yet available for Direct Routing.

>[!NOTE]
 Blocked callers may experience slightly different behaviors when they have been blocked. The behavior will be based on how the blocked caller’s carrier handles the notification that the call is not allowed to be successfully completed. Examples may include a carrier message stating the call cannot be completed as dialed, or simply dropping the call.

#### Call Blocking Admin Controls and Information
Admin controls for blocking numbers are provided using PowerShell only. Number block patterns are defined as regular expression patterns. The order of the expressions is unimportant – the first pattern matched in the list will result in the call being blocked. A new number or pattern added or removed in the blocked callers list may take up to 24 hours to for the pattern to become active.
#### Call Blocking PowerShell Commands

*InboundBlockedNumberPattern*
Number patterns are managed via the *CsInboundBlockedNumberPattern* commands **New**, **Get**, **Set**, and **Remove**.  

You can manage a given pattern by using these cmdlets, including the ability to toggle the activation of a given pattern.
- *Get-CsInboundBlockedNumberPattern*
Returns a list of all blocked number patterns added to the tenant list including Name, Description, Enabled (True/False), and Pattern for each.
- *New-CsInboundBlockedNumberPattern*
Adds a blocked number pattern to the tenant list.
- *Remove-CsInboundBlockedNumberPattern*
Removes a blocked number pattern from the tenant list.
- *Set-CsInboundBlockedNumberPattern*
Modifies one or more parameters of a blocked number pattern in the tenant list.
- *TenantBlockedCallingNumbers*
The viewing and activation of the entire call blocking feature is managed via the CsTenantBlockingCallingNumbers commands Get and Set. 
- *Get-CsTenantBlockedCallingNumbers*
Returns the parameters for the global blocked number list including Enabled (True/False). There is a single global tenant policy that cannot be modified manually other than to turn the feature completely on/off.
- *Set-CsTenantBlockedCallingNumbers*
Allows modifying the global tenant blocked calls to be turned on/off at the tenant level.

#### Examples
### Blocking a Number

In this example, the -Enabled and -Description parameters are optional:

`New-CsInboundBlockedNumberPattern -Name “<name>” -Enabled $True -Description “<description>” -Pattern “^[+]?13125550000”`

 Creating a new pattern will by default add the pattern as enabled, and the description is always and optional field to provide more information. 

We recommend that you provide a meaningful name to easily understand why the pattern was added. In the case of simply blocking spam numbers, considered naming the rule the same as the number pattern being matched, and add additional information in the description as required.

Patterns are matched using Regular Expressions (regex). 
Allow for replication time before testing and validating.

### Allowing a Number

In this example, the identity parameter is  required:
`Remove-CsInboundBlockedNumberPattern -Identity “<identity>”`
 
If the Identity is not known, use the *Get-CsInboundBlockedNumberPattern* cmdlet to first locate the proper pattern and note the Identity. Then, run the *Remove* cmdlet and pass the appropriate Identity value.

Allow for replication time before testing and validating.
#### View all Number Patterns
Running this cmdlet will return a list of all entered blocked numbers for a tenant: 
`Get-CsInboundBlockedNumberPattern`

Use built-in PowerShell filtering abilities to parse the returned values as required.

#### A Note on Regex
As stated earlier, the pattern matching for blocking callers is done by using Regular Expressions (regex). There are multiple tools available online to help validate a regex pattern match. If you are not familiar with regex patterns, we recommend that you take some time to familiarize yourself with the basics and to make sure you get expected results, use a tool for validating pattern matches before you add new blocked number matches to your tenant.
